Minestorms:
    - still need to update firmware


Inventory system:
    - some done, joe looking at 3D models (sketchup?)

People are annoyed at SR, considering kicking them out of our cupboard?
Is it better to be friends? If so, should we have a list of 'available equipment'
The inventory system is big problem + cupboard, we really need them to use it properly.
They are using our laptops, we want to add BIOS passwords to make sure they don't replace the OS
Is there anything we want to ask SR for?
    - Better communication: from them to us
    -            and from us to tell them if things are inadequate
RUBs need clearer labelling SR vs SRO and new inventory system should tightly intergrate this
Get SROs stuff from SR RUBs (Pis)
Their stuff inc barcode scanners? Is the cupboard for storage or shared day-to-day usage?
TLDR: Formalise our relationship with them *DRAFT UP*
        including inventory interface; Pi in cupboard project (how to use the cupboard poster?)

to discuss with SR:
    Burnout is killing our volunteers - not supportive response, assigning of SR tasks needs oversight
    safety of cupboard
    git facism - assumed knowledge of how SR use git? Badly handled with force
            more communication before deleting stuff
            is this indirectly a time management issue?
